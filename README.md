# Django Components (with htxml) Demo

This project demonstrates using a combination of:

- django components
- htmx

To encapsulate both backend and frontend behaviour for a component.

The folder structure is slightly different to most dbca django projects as I used the 
standard django project struture provided by django without modifications.
